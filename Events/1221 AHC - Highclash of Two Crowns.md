# ***HIGHLASH OF TWO CROWNS

### Year 1221 AHW (After the Hundred-Year Holy Crusade).  
After the death of the Bastard Emperor, [[Paul I von Klaus]], the Empire fell into instability due to the arrival of refugees from Wes’terra.  
They called themselves the [[Bayezid]] Soy, demanding land to settle on, but the Emperor ignored their demands in his tyranny.  
Seeking to control them by force, [[Paul I von Klaus]] tried to integrate them into the northern warden state — but his efforts backfired.

House [[Frost]] had long been close to the Imperial line through royal marriages; even the Emperor’s wife, [[Emilia Frost]] , was of that house. Yet, the failure in the north stirred opposition within [[Frost]]’s own court.

### Year 1222 AHW.  
The chaos within the Empire did not subside, and at the beginning of the year, a great plague swept across the continent, killing nearly 5% of the population.  
Trade between Es’terra and Wes’terra collapsed under quarantine and blockades, bringing widespread scarcity. Amid these calamities, House [[Blaze]] began secretly plotting a coup d’état to reorganize and control the empire.

### Year 1223 AHW.  
The opposition coalesced around House [[Blaze]]. The first to join their cause was House [[Aenhardt]], a family bound by blood to the Imperial House [[Von Klaus]].  
They ruled the cities of Goldneck and Brightshore, commanding the greatest navy on the continent.

The third power to join the opposition was the [[Bayezid]] Soy. Initially unorganized, they were shaped into a formal noble house with the administrative and military support of House [[Blaze]], taking the name House [[Bayezid]] in the north.That summer, they attempted to usurp the throne but failed to capture Thronesland. They retreated to Flammstate, the capital of House [[Blaze]], to regroup.

The following year, the Loyalists rallied their forces — comprising House [[Frost]], House [[Sanders]], and the Imperial House [[Von Klaus]].  
The two armies clashed on the western fields of Flammstate. Both sides suffered devastating losses, yet the Revolutionary Forces emerged victorious thanks to the cavalry of House [[Bayezid]] and the elite flame mages of House [[Blaze]].

The Loyalists then fortified Thronesland, the continental capital, for one final stand.  
The Revolutionary army marched again the next year — better prepared, stronger, and more ruthless.  
  

The siege lasted for three months. The Revolutionary Forces declared their candidate for the throne: Kaarjha Aenhardt, a steel-hearted woman who wielded her ties to House Blaze — the true puppet masters behind the civil war.

By the second month of the siege, all hope seemed lost for the attackers. Unless a miracle occurred, the city could have withstood the assault for years. But then, something unexpected happened.

Certain aristocrats of the Loyalist faction — chiefly from House Sanders — proposed negotiations. Weary and disillusioned, House Sanders had lost faith in the Loyalist Emperor, Charles IV von Klaus. He was only a teenager, and there was no hope left in him.

Records from House Aenhardt describe the young Emperor as an emotionless and cruel sociopath who thirsted for blood. During the siege, he blamed his court for every failure, had them executed, and declared himself the sole ruler — a one-man dictatorship. He even demanded a fifteen-year-old girl from House Sanders as his second wife.

Because of this madness, House Sanders and a few survivors from the Imperial Castle offered a white peace, surrendering both the throne and the city to the Revolutionaries. In the end, they opened the Great Gates of Thronesland, delivering the capital into the hands of the Aenhardt rebels.

The Loyalist Emperor, Charles IV von Klaus, son of Paul, was slain by the new queen — Kaarjha Aenhardt, the Usurper.

Thus ended the war, later known as the Highclash of Kings.

House Bayezid was proclaimed the new Warden of the North, driving House Frost from their ancestral lands.  
Rumors say the remnants of House Frost now dwell with House von Midon, an independent realm in the southern lands.

But House von Klaus was not so fortunate — the death of Charles IV marked the end of the Thousand-Year Imperial Bloodline of Es’terra.

After the war, peace did not return to the continent. The dwarves of the east declared their independence once more and began preparing a massive offensive toward the northern stronghold — the honored Blue Keep.
